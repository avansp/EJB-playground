# EJB-playground

This is my sandbox to learn Enterprise Java Beans using JBoss application server 7.1 with JDK 1.7 using Eclipse. 

# Pre-requisites

* [Eclipse Luna](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/luna/sr2) -- this only works with JBoss Tools 4.2.3 and Java 7
* [JBoss Tools 4.2.3.Final](http://tools.jboss.org/downloads/jbosstools/luna/4.2.3.Final.html) plugin for Eclipse (search from Marketplace) -- this is the last version that can work with Java 7

# Some pointers:

* [Installing JBoss Tools in Eclipse IDE for JBoss As 7.1.0.Final](http://www.javaguru.biz/installing-jboss-tools-in-eclipse-ide-for-jboss-as-7-1-0-final/)
